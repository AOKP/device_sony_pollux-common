    <!-- Flag indicating whether the current device is "voice capable".
         If true, this means that the device supports circuit-switched
         (i.e. voice) phone calls over the telephony network, and is
         allowed to display the in-call UI while a cellular voice call is
         active.  This can be overridden to false for "data only" devices
         which can't make voice calls and don't support any in-call UI.

         Note: this flag is subtly different from the
         PackageManager.FEATURE_TELEPHONY system feature, which is
         available on *any* device with a telephony radio, even if the
         device is data-only. -->

    <!-- Enable emergency call when sim is locked or puk locked. Some countries/carriers do not
         allow emergency calls to be placed without the IMSI, which is locked in the SIM.
         If so, this should be set to 'false' in an overlay. -->

    <!-- Hardware 'face' keys present on the device, stored as a bit field.
         This integer should equal the sum of the corresponding value for each
         of the following keys present:
             1 - Home
             2 - Back
             4 - Menu
             8 - Assistant (search)
            16 - App switch
            32 - Camera
         For example, a device with Home, Back and Menu keys would set this
         config to 7. -->
